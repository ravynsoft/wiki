# Setting up

Now that the Wiki has been forked, we can setup our developer environment to preview & debug our website, setting up requires that you:

 - Have a working npm installation
 - Have either `pnpm` or `yarn` installed
 - Have your forked repository cloned and opened in your terminal

<Steps>
### To setup your Wiki environment, we will run a command to download all of the dependencies needed for Wiki to run:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.
</Callout>

```sh
npm install
```

### Now that you have all NPM dependencies installed, we will run another command to open the Wiki in a live-server:

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'pnpm', 'npx']}>
  <Tab>
  ```sh
  yarn dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```sh
  pnpm next
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```sh
  npx next
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Steps>
Once your live-server has been initialized, you can freely incorporate your changes via your IDE/TextEditor and witness them changing in real-time with hot-reload.
